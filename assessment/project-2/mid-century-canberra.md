## Website title
Mid-century Canberra

### Logo
No logo provided - please use appropriate text.

### Target audience
Anyone interested in design and architecture in the region and abroad. 

### Background info
This website will showcase mid-century architecture in Canberra. This area is currently the focus of renewed attention through the efforts of Design Canberra and the Canberra and Region Heritage Festival (among others). 

### Required content
We envisage that the website will have a number of sections:

*   News
*   Houses
*   Architects
*   Locations
*   About/Contact/Contribute

These names are tentative - you might think of a better option. Here is a breakdown of the content required:

#### News
We need to be able to post news items. These might contain long form text, event information or just a few images. Each news item will need to have tags or categories so they can be easily navigated. Users will need to be able to comment on news stories, but we don’t want to receive any spam. 

#### Houses
Information about the houses to be included is available in the text files. Some of the content is longer than others. Each will include at least 1 image, sometimes there will be multiple images and a gallery of some kind might work better. 

It’d be great if users were able to submit comments regarding the houses, but these would need to be moderated before being visible on the site. 

#### Architects
There are a number of architect profiles to be included. It’d be good if the architects were linked to the houses they worked on and vice-versa.

#### Locations
It would be great to have some kind of interactive map to allow users to find the different houses based on location. 

#### About/Contact/Contribute
Please include a contact form to collect the users name, location, message, and potentially an image. 

## Other requirements
*   Site should look good on all device sizes
*   Site should be fast to load and not require any browser plugin installation (e.g. flash player)
*   We need to be able to edit the content ourselves, so will need editor functionality
*   No spam
*   Moderation of comments 
*   Need to be able to search for content
*   Images should always include captions and copyright information if available


The footer of every page needs to include the following statement:

```
