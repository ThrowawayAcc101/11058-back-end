# The Tocumwal Archive
Some of you may have used this content before in Front-end or web design and production. That's fine. This time, we'll move substantially beyond how it was used in that unit. 

You need to think carefully about how to display the content and fulfil the requirements of the brief and the assessment item. 

You can see an archived version of the original *The Tocumwal Archive* website in the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20170217114229/http://thetocumwalarchive.photoaccess.org.au/). 

If you have any questions, please post on Canvas or email Ben.

## Brief

### Website title 
The Tocumwal Archive

### Logo
No logo provided - please use appropriate text.

### Target audience
All ages, gender and backgrounds. 

### Background information
This website is being developed to build awareness of the Tocumwal Housing precinct. It will be a community resource full of local stories, images, news and other relevant information. 

### Required content
We envisage that the website will have a number of sections:

*   News
*   About
*   Stories
*   Gallery
*   Get in touch

These names are tentative - you might think of a better option. Here is a breakdown of the content required:

#### News
We need to be able to post news items. These might contain long form text, event information or just a few images. Each news item will need to have tags or categories so they can be easily navigated. Users will need to be able to comment on news stories, but we don’t want to receive any spam. 

#### About
To contain information about the heritage listing and an embedded map. 

#### Stories
We’ve collected a number of stories from past residents. These should be available in an engaging, easy to read, manner. Some are short form, some are quite long, some even include poetry! The stories are currently broken into themes based around time but it might also work if they were based around the streets (each story has a resident’s name and street listed). Images could be included to break up the text. 

Ideally, we’d like to be able to gather stories from users as well. These would need to be moderated before appearing on the site. 

#### Gallery
We have quite a few images to add to the site. These consist of:
*   Some of these are photos of houses and people
*   Plans from the National Archive of Australia
*   Photos from Trove (National Library of Australia)

They should be accessible through either a single filterable gallery, or multiple galleries. If a user clicks on the photo they should see the caption and a larger version. 

#### Get in touch
Please include a contact form to collect the users name, location and message. 

### Other requirements
*   Site should look good on all device sizes
*   Site should be fast to load and not require any browser plugin installation (e.g. flash player)
*   We need to be able to edit the content ourselves, so will need editor functionality
*   No spam
*   Moderation of comments or new stories
*   Need to be able to search for content
*   Images should always include captions and copyright information if available

The footer of every page needs to include the following statement
