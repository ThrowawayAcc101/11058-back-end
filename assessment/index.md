## Assessment information

### Project 2

Content Management System Website

In this project you will work in small groups (2-3 people), to create a website using a current industry-standard CMS. 

You can choose which CMS you want to use, but you must use the source content provided to you (options below). 

### Brief and source content
There are 2 different briefs available. Both have originated through discussions with their currrent stakeholders. You can choose which one you want to use:

*   [The Tocumwal Archive](project-2/tocumwal.md)
*   [Mid-Century Canberra](project-2/mid-century-canberra.md)

Please visit the pages above where you will find detailed information regarding each project. 

### Group project
This is a group work project that will be managed by employing the SCRUM methodology, and supported with Trello. You will be assessed for your individual contribution, and it is your responsibility to keep track of these contributions.

Applying the SCRUM methodology, each group will work through developing their projects in a number of “sprints”.
