# Part 2: the delete page

## Deleting 

* 	This is very straightforwards. 
* 	Copy all the content from `update.php` into the `delete.php` file
* 	Alter the edit link so it looks like:
`<a href=delete.php?id=<?php echo $row['id']; ?>'>Delete</a>`

Change the php to the following (comments included in the code):

```
  // include the config file 
    require "../config.php";
    require "common.php";

    // This code will only run if the delete button is clicked
    if (isset($_GET["id"])) {
	    // this is called a try/catch statement 
        try {
            // define database connection
            $connection = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password, $options);
            
            // set id variable
            $id = $_GET["id"];
            
            // Create the SQL 
            $sql = "DELETE FROM works WHERE id = :id";

            // Prepare the SQL
            $statement = $connection->prepare($sql);
            
            // bind the id to the PDO
            $statement->bindValue(':id', $id);
            
            // execute the statement
            $statement->execute();

            // Success message
            $success = "Work successfully deleted";

        } catch(PDOException $error) {
            // if there is an error, tell us what it is
            echo $sql . "<br>" . $error->getMessage();
        }
    };

    // This code runs on page load
    try {
        $connection = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password, $options);
		
        // SECOND: Create the SQL 
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM works";
        
        // THIRD: Prepare the SQL
        $statement = $connection->prepare($sql);
        $statement->execute();
        
        // FOURTH: Put it into a $result object that we can access in the page
        $result = $statement->fetchAll();
    } catch(PDOException $error) {
        echo $sql . "<br>" . $error->getMessage();
    }
```

Refresh your page, and you should be able to delete an item. 
*   If nothing is showing up, make sure you haven't deleted everything in the database!

## Wrap up
Once you get the code working from Week 4 and 5 you have the key back-end code components required for the first assignment. You should start thinking about this project in detail, ask yourself:
*   What do you want to track?
*   What data would you collect?
*   What other examples of similar web apps exist?

Next week we'll talk frameworks and talk about the assignment more.
