# 6.2  Package managers and libraries

As we remember from part 1, both frameworks and libraries are collections of code written by someone else that is used to help solve common problems. 

## Library
A reusable piece of code you want to use in your project. As with the frameworks, there are thousands of these available! 

For example, say I wanted to extend my Work Tracker app to allow the user to upload an image, rather than writing the code which automatically sets the file name, image sizes etc, I’d save my time by using a library like [ImageCow](https://github.com/oscarotero/imagecow)

Say then that I wanted to be able to browse my images by the most used colours, instead of writing the colour analysis myself (which would take forever!) and be prone to mistakes, I could try using this [ColorExtractor](https://github.com/thephpleague/color-extractor) library. 

For the assignment, you'll notice that it says a user should be able to register and log in to your web app - well, rather than writing the code to do that, the better approach would be to use a PHP library like [PHP Auth](https://github.com/delight-im/PHP-Auth) or something similar. As the developer writes:

> Re-implementing a new authentication system for every PHP project is not a good idea.
> Building your own authentication classes piece by piece, and copying it to every project, is not recommended, either.


Essentially, you utilise libraries to do some of the heavy lifting of a specific component. 

It can be a trial and error process though, try one and if it doesn’t work, move onto another. If you write a great piece of code which you think might be useful to others then you might release it on GitHub. 

### How to find a good library?
Google is your friend. 

There are also many lists:
*	[Awesome PHP](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php): A curated list of amazingly awesome PHP libraries, resources and shiny things.
*	[24 Cool PHP libraries](https://tutorialzine.com/2013/02/24-cool-php-libraries-you-should-know-about)

**Note, I’ve included PHP examples here, but libraries exist for all languages**

Now, the obvious question is, if you are going to use all these different libraries, then how do you install them/keep track of them? 

Answer: Use a package manager

## A package manager

Put simply:

> A package manager is a set of tools that automates and manages computer software. They deal with packages, or collections, of bundled files. Package managers make it easy to install, upgrade, or remove software for a computer's operating system.

Source: {Devopedia Package Manager](https://devopedia.org/package-manager) 

So, it’s something you install on your computer (through the command line) that allows you to easily add, maintain and remove packaged libraries from your project. 

There are different package managers for different programming languages. A few of the most common ones are:
*	[Composer]() (PHP)
*	[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) (JS)
*	[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (JS)
*	[Parcel](https://parceljs.org) (JS)
*	[PiP](https://github.com/pypa/pip) (Python)
*	[RubyGems](https://rubygems.org) (Ruby)

## How do I know which one to use 
Again, depends on your language, but generally if you’re looking at a particular library, it’ll tell you how to install it. Most of the time this will be by entering something like:

```
$ gem install bundler
```

Which, given that the first part is `gem` I know I need to have already installed Ruby. 

## Why are package managers so important?
Ok, so we understand that use them to easily install libraries for our project. That’s all pretty straightforward. But where they become super useful is when you are using particular versions of software in your project, you need to be able to keep track of what version of each library you are using so that you don’t break it when you upgrade. 

When you use a package manager, you can easily say `install this ...`, the package manager is smart enough to know that code A depends on the latest version of code B and will install both to ensure your web app remains functional. 

## Will I use it?

For the first project, probably not, it will depend on the level of complexity of your tracker app. But you might!
