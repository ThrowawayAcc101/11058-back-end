## Making your web app available online 

## Two options

You have two choices, depending on whether or not you want to keep your local data available when you acccess it online.

**Note, you must have already signed up for web hosting to do this!**

1. [Clean slate (don't keep the data)](7.1.md)
2. [Keep the data](7.2.md)

To make your site accessible online you need move all of your files to the web server, recreate the database and update any of the configuration files to ensure you are using the correct database login details.

To transfer the files, you need to use File Transfer Protocol (FTP). When you signed up for web hosting, your host will have provided you with your FTP login details. 

To use FTP you need to download [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org) (free for all platforms).
