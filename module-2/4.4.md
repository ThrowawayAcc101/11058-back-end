## Part 2: back-end code


#### Config file
*   Create a new file in the site directory and call it `config.php`

Add the following:

...
```
<?php

$host       = "localhost";
$username   = "root";
$password   = "root";
$dbname     = "test"; // will use later
$dsn        = "mysql:host=$host;dbname=$dbname"; // will use later
$options    = array(
                PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION
              );

```
We are using the default host, username and password, as specified earlier.
We’ll call this script from our php pages, by putting it in one spot we are keeping our code DRY

#### Edit the create page
*   Ok, we’re getting there slowly…
*   Open up `create.php`
*   On the first line of the file, we'll add the following code (comments included in the code):

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ben-ennis-butler/4d2b6236efc9cc4949b2827ae5f17297.js"></script>

Don't add the `include`.

Ok great, now let’s go back to the browser (try (http://localhost)[http://localhost]) and reload the page

##### Troubleshooting
*   If it doesn’t load it means something is wrong, check your code and try again. The code must match **exactly**.
*   Check the logs

PC:
*   Go to `C:/MAMP/Logs` 
*   Look for `php_error.log`
*   Open it in a text editor
*   Look through the log for the most recent error and see what it says

MAC: 
*   Go to `~User/Applications/MAMP/Logs`
*   Look for `php_error.log`
*   Open it in a text editor
*   Look through the log for the most recent error and see what it says

#### It works! 
If the page loads, great!

Fill in the form and click `submit`

*   Then, go to phpMyAdmin (try: (http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin)[http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin] or access it through MAMP Web Page > tools) 
*   Click the `browse` tab, which should reload the database and show the new information we just added!

#### User feedback
*   The only thing missing at this point is some feedback to tell the user that the form submission was successful. 

Add the following code below our `include` statement

...
```
<?php if (isset($_POST['submit']) && $statement) { ?>
<p>Work successfully added.</p>
<?php } ?>

```

If you have any errors, please check the code in the repo exactly

#### Create page and database setup done!
*   Good work.
*   The hard bit is over

#### Let’s display some results
*   Go to the `read.php` file we created earlier
*   We’ll use a select statement to get all the data from the database. 
*   Add the following code on line 1 (before the include for `header.php`): 

...
```
<?php 

// this code will only execute after the submit button is clicked
if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
	
    // include the config file that we created before
    require "../config.php"; 
    
    // this is called a try/catch statement 
	try {
        // FIRST: Connect to the database
        $connection = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password, $options);
		
        // SECOND: Create the SQL 
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM works";
        
        // THIRD: Prepare the SQL
        $statement = $connection->prepare($sql);
        $statement->execute();
        
        // FOURTH: Put it into a $result object that we can access in the page
        $result = $statement->fetchAll();

	} catch(PDOException $error) {
        // if there is an error, tell us what it is
		echo $sql . "<br>" . $error->getMessage();
	}	
}
?>

```

You'll see it is pretty much the same as the `create.php` connection. You could even take the `create.php` code and change a few bits...

*   That code gets the data from the database, now let’s actually show it on the page. 
*   Add the following code on line 1 (before the include for `header.php`):

...
```

<?php  
    if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
        //if there are some results
        if ($result && $statement->rowCount() > 0) { ?>
<h2>Results</h2>

<?php 
                // This is a loop, which will loop through each result in the array
                foreach($result as $row) { 
            ?>

<p>
    ID:
    <?php echo $row["id"]; ?><br> Artist Name:
    <?php echo $row['artistname']; ?><br> Work Title:
    <?php echo $row['worktitle']; ?><br> Work Date:
    <?php echo $row['workdate']; ?><br> Work type:
    <?php echo $row['worktype']; ?><br>
</p>
<?php 
                            // this willoutput all the data from the array
                            //echo '<pre>'; var_dump($row); 
                        ?>

<hr>
<?php }; //close the foreach
        }; 
    }; 
?>

```

The whole file should look like:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ben-ennis-butler/2cf2d16e6adb35b82cf728a22bb95bbc.js"></script>


Now let’s jump back to our page and have a look!

When we hit the show all button, you will see the database results! 

That's it for now. 

#### Great work!
