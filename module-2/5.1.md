## Part 1: the update page

#### Introduction
*   Last week we started craeting our first CRUD app. 
*   We wrote a script which creates the database
*   We made a `create.php` and a `read.php` page
*   We then connected to that new MySQL database 
*   Now we need to make the `update.php` and `delete.php` pages


### Getting started
Let’s start by updating our index.php and header.php pages to include navigation so we can actually click between the pages. 
*	On `index.php` I will remove the `<ul>` 
*	Open `header.php` and paste the `<ul>` after the `<h1>`
*	Add in two new menu items:

```
        <li><a href="update.php">Edit an artwork</a></li>
        <li><a href="delete.php">Delete an artwork</a></li>
```

### Now create those pages:
*	Create a new page, save it as `update.php`, save in the `public` folder
*	Create a new page, save it as `delete.php`, save in the `public` folder
*	Create a new page, save it as `update-work.php`, save in the `public` folder

## Updating 

### Let’s work on the `update.php` page first
Open up `read.php`, copy all of the content and paste it into the new `update.php` page. 

As with the `read.php` page, we’ll use a simple `SELECT` statement to grab all the works in the database. The code will essentially stay the same, but we need to change how it is called. 

This means we need to delete the parts which are only executed when the button is clicked. 

**First**
* 	First, look for this section 

`if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {` 

at the top of the page. Delete that and delete the closing curly bracket on line 26 - it will go red to indicate it shouldn’t be there. 
* 	Now the code will run as soon as you load the page

**Second**

*	Scroll down to this line: `if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {` around line 33. 

*	We need to remove the following code:

```
<?php  
    if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
        //if there are some results
        if ($result && $statement->rowCount() > 0) { ?>
```

Then, we need to ensure we remove the closing tags too. Look to line 54-55 (on my example) and delete the corresponding curly brackets

```
}
} 
```

Ok, now save and refresh the page in the browser. 

You should see a list of all the items in the database.

### Now, let’s add the ability to edit that content 

Within the `<p>` tags, we’ll add a link to edit the entry. Scroll down to the closing `</p>` tag, and immediately before it, and the following:

``` 
    <a href='update-work.php?id=<?php echo $row['id']; ?>'>Edit</a>
```

**How does this work?!**
When we click on the edit link we will send the id as parameter in the url. This will allow us to easily access the correct work when we go to edit it. This is known as a [HTML Query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string). You can add lots of parameters to the URL, it’s how you keep track between different pages. Go have a look at the URL from a Google search, you’ll see that after the `?` there are a whole lot of parameters. 

If you refresh the page now, you’ll see the edit links are there. 

Hover over the links and you should see the url includes the id parameter but nothing happens when you click on the page. Let’s do that now… 

### Creating `update-work.php`
* 	Open up the file we made earlier (or create it now if you haven’t already got it)
* 	Instead of using `$_POST` like we did in the `create.php` and `read.php` files, we’ll use `$_GET` to grab the information from the url 
*	In our `update-work.php` file, add the following:

```
<?php 

    // include the config file that we created last week
    require "../config.php";

    //simple if/else statement to check if the id is available
    if (isset($_GET['id'])) {
        //yes the id exists 
        
        // quickly show the id on the page
        echo $_GET['id'];
        
    } else {
        // no id, show error
        echo "No id - something went wrong";
        //exit;
    }
?>
```

*	Test in the browser. Click a link and you should see the id is shown on the new page.

### Display the data

*	Within in `if` statement, let’s add in a try/catch statement and prepare our database connection (code follows at end)
*	We’ll set the id as a variable, so we can easily refer to it again : `$id = $_GET['id'];`
*	Then we’ll use a `SELECT` statement to get the right work entry from the database, using the id:

```
        try {
            // standard db connection
            $connection = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password, $options);
            
            // set if as variable
            $id = $_GET['id'];
            
            //select statement to get the right data
            $sql = "SELECT * FROM works WHERE id = :id";
            
            // prepare the connection
            $statement = $connection->prepare($sql);
            
            //bind the id to the PDO id
            $statement->bindValue(':id', $id);
            
            // now execute the statement
            $statement->execute();
            
            // attach the sql statement to the new work variable so we can access it in the form
            $work = $statement->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
            
        } catch(PDOExcpetion $error) {
            echo $sql . "<br>" . $error->getMessage();
        }

```

### Add the form fields

*	The fields shown are the same as those on the `create.php` page, so we’ll go and copy those, and make a few changes
*	For each one I’ve added in the value, and set it to the matching response from the database:

```
<form method="post">
    
    <label for="id">ID</label>
    <input type="text" name="id" id="id" value="<?php echo $work['id']; ?>" >
    
    <label for="artistname">Artist Name</label>
    <input type="text" name="artistname" id="artistname" value="<?php echo $work['artistname']; ?>">

    <label for="worktitle">Work Title</label>
    <input type="text" name="worktitle" id="worktitle" value="<?php echo $work['worktitle']; ?>">

    <label for="workdate">Work Date</label>
    <input type="text" name="workdate" id="workdate" value="<?php echo $work['workdate']; ?>">

    <label for="worktype">Work Type</label>
    <input type="text" name="worktype" id="worktype" value="<?php echo $work['worktype']; ?>">
    
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Save">

</form>
```

### Escape the data 

In order to actually save the data you will need to escape the HTML first. The main aim here is to convert any special characters into a HTML entity. You can read more [here](http://php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars.php).

*   Start by creating a new page, call it `common.php` and save it in the `public` folder
*   Open the `<?php` script and insert the following code:

```
function escape($html) { 
    return htmlspecialchars($html, ENT_QUOTES | ENT_SUBSTITUTE, "UTF-8"); 
}
```
*   Make sure you close the php at the end of the file: `?>` 
*   Close the document - we won't use it again.

Now you need to actually include that file in your `update-work.php` file. 
*   On a new line after the `config.php` require at the top of the document, add the following:

```
require "common.php";
```

Great, we'll refer to it soon. 

### Update the form fields
In my form, I now need to apply the escape function I created in my `common.php` file. 

If you look at how we display the id, we currently have:

```
<?php echo $work['id']; ?>
```
To call the escape() function, I need to wrap it around the contents of the tag like so:

```
<?php echo escape($work['id']); ?>
```

The full line will look like:

```
<input type="text" name="id" id="id" value="<?php echo escape($work['id']); ?>" >
```

You should go through and add it to all of your fields:

```
    <label for="id">ID</label>
    <input type="text" name="id" id="id" value="<?php echo escape($work['id']); ?>" >
    
    <label for="artistname">Artist Name</label>
    <input type="text" name="artistname" id="artistname" value="<?php echo escape($work['artistname']); ?>">

    <label for="worktitle">Work Title</label>
    <input type="text" name="worktitle" id="worktitle" value="<?php echo escape($work['worktitle']); ?>">

    <label for="workdate">Work Date</label>
    <input type="text" name="workdate" id="workdate" value="<?php echo escape($work['workdate']); ?>">

    <label for="worktype">Work Type</label>
    <input type="text" name="worktype" id="worktype" value="<?php echo escape($work['worktype']); ?>">
    
    <label for="date">Work Date</label>
    <input type="text" name="date" id="date" value="<?php echo escape($work['date']); ?>">

    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Save">
```

### Save the data
We've got the form fields showing on the page, but now, let’s get the actual save button to work.
*	At the top of the `update-work.php` page, below the `require "common.php";`, I’ll add my standard submit button code, with a try/catch and database connection:

```
    // run when submit button is clicked
    if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
        try {
            $connection = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password, $options);  
            
            
            } catch(PDOException $error) {
            echo $sql . "<br>" . $error->getMessage();
        }
    }
```

*	Then, I’ll include a whole bit of code which grabs the values from the form, and updates the database accordingly:

```
    //grab elements from form and set as varaible
    $work =[
      "id"         => $_POST['id'],
      "artistname" => $_POST['artistname'],
      "worktitle"  => $_POST['worktitle'],
      "workdate"   => $_POST['workdate'],
      "worktype"   => $_POST['worktype'],
      "date"   => $_POST['date'],
    ];

    // create SQL statement
    $sql = "UPDATE `works` 
            SET id = :id, 
                artistname = :artistname, 
                worktitle = :worktitle, 
                workdate = :workdate, 
                worktype = :worktype, 
                date = :date 
            WHERE id = :id";

    //prepare sql statement
    $statement = $connection->prepare($sql);

    //execute sql statement
    $statement->execute($work);


```

The full file should look like:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ben-ennis-butler/1002bd702885bd3faf874707d9919ccc.js"></script>

Great, now we should be able to edit a work, click save and see the content update.
