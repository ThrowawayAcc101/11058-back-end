## Part 2: database creation

#### Open the project
* Go to your code editor and open the new project
* If in brackets, change the site folder so that you are editing the right files
* We need to open phpMyAdmin, which is where we can manage the database. 
* You can access phpMyAdmin through the MAMP interface, or try: `http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin/?lang=en` 
* We’ll write an SQL query, and then run it in phpMyAdmin

##### Default login (good to know for later)
*   The default host is: `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`
*   The default login username and password is: `root`

#### Database creation 
*   Then create a new file and save it as `db-create.sql`
*   In this new file, we’ll write the following:

```
CREATE DATABASE ben_test;

use ben_test;

CREATE TABLE works (
	id INT(10) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, 
	artistname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
	worktitle VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	workdate VARCHAR(30),
    worktype VARCHAR(30),
	date TIMESTAMP
);


```
**Note**
No spaces or dashes in the names, must match form from before

SQL is easy to read and it is pretty obvious what is going on here. 
*   `INT()` = integer (a number, up to 10 characters long)
*   `AUTO_INCREMENT` = a number that will increase - i.e. A unique id 
*   `VARCHAR()` = variable character, can contain letters and numbers
*   `TIMESTAMP` = will add current time, so we know when created, edited etc

#### Let’s create the database

#### Jump back to phpMyAadmin
*   Click the SQL tab at the top of phpMyAdmin
*   Copy the contents from the db-create.sql file into the text area and hit go. 
*   It will create the database, let’s check. 

#### Check the database
*   Click the new database name in the left column `ben_test` 
*   You’ll see a table called `works`, if you click that you’ll see columns with each of the information we created before, but with no content - this is great, means it is all working well!
*   If something didn’t work you need to delete the database and start again. Click the `operations` tab, scroll down until you see `DROP`, and click it and click `ok`
