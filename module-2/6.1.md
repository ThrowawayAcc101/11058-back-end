# Back-end frameworks

Before looking at back-end frameworks in detail you need to understand the concept of the Model-View-Controller pattern. 

## Model-View-Controller

Commonly referred to as MVC.

It is a pattern which divides the application into three parts - all of which are connected together: 
*	Model: Manages data and business logic.
*	View: Handles layout and display.
*	Controller: Takes in user commands, sends commands to the model for data updates, sends instructions to view to update interface.

On a modern web app, that process would look like this:
*   The user makes a request along a route (e.g. /home or /works).
*   The controller receives this request and gives a specific set of orders that are related to that route. These instructions could either be for the view to update or serve a certain page, or for the model to perform specific logic. Let’s assume this request has some logic associated with it.
*   The model carries out the logic, pulls from a database and sends back a consistent response based on the controller’s instructions.
*   The controller then passes this data to the view to update the user interface.

Read a good example here: [MVC explained](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/model-view-controller-mvc-explained-through-ordering-drinks-at-the-bar-efcba6255053)

Understanding the MVC model is important because many back-end frameworks utilise this pattern.

## What is a framework or library?
Both frameworks and libraries are collections of code written by someone else that is used to help solve common problems. 

You are probably already familiar with front-end html frameworks (e.g. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com), [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/] etc), or front-end JS frameworks (e.g. [Angular](https://angular.io), [React](https://reactjs.org), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Ember](https://emberjs.com] etc) the aim of these is to simplify the design and development process and allow you to quickly and easily get a web app up and running. 

A back-end framework functions in much the same way. Rather than having to write commonly used functions you can rely on the framework to that for you and instead build your web app on top of the framework. As we’ve seen, writing PHP can be tedious, time consuming and problematic - use of a framework will help to alleviate some of these issues. 

There are HUNDREDS of frameworks available. It is important not to be consumed by them and consider it as the solution to all your problems. In many cases the framework will have considerably more functions than you need to use  and you’ll need to make a conscious decision about whether or not you should actually use it or what the alternatives are. 

Jeremy Zeldman wrote about this issue in his great post [_The Cult of the Complex_](https://alistapart.com/article/cult-of-the-complex) on  A List Apart in 2018:

>There’s nothing wrong with using frameworks to quickly whip up and test product prototypes, especially if you do that testing in a non-public space. And theoretically, if you know what you’re doing, and are willing to edit out the bits your product doesn’t need, there’s nothing wrong with using a framework to launch a public site. Notice the operative phrases: _if you know what you’re doing, and are willing to edit out the bits your product doesn’t need._

He goes onto to say:

> “Indeed, many designers and developers I speak with would rather dance naked in public than admit to posting a site built with hand-coded, progressively enhanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript they understand and wrote themselves. For them, it’s a matter of job security and viability. There’s almost a fear that if you haven’t mastered a dozen new frameworks and tools each year (and by mastered, I mean used), you’re slipping behind into irrelevancy. “

Whilst many of his comments refer to front-end frameworks, the issue is the same with back-end frameworks. 

## Common back-end frameworks

There are *many* [different frameworks](https://hackr.io/blog/top-10-web-development-frameworks-in-2019) for various programming  languages. Here are a few of the more popular ones:

### Symfony (PHP)
*   Released in 2005. [symfony.com](https://symfony.com)
*   "Symfony is a set of PHP Components, a Web Application framework, a Philosophy, and a Community — all working together in harmony."
*   It is very easy to get started with and there is a great tutorial [here](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html). Installation is from the command line. You will need to install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) first (see part 2 about package managers). 

### Laravel (PHP)
*	Released in 2011. [Laravel.com](https://laravel.com)
*	Based on Symfony. Uses MVC pattern. 
*	By far the most popular at the moment
*	[Made with Laravel](https://madewithlaravel.com)

### Others (all PHP)
*	Yii
*	Zend
*	Cake
*	CodeIgnitor

### But which one is best?
There is no easy answer. Depends on what you are using it for…

There's some great information from the Mozilla MDN which is worth a read: [How to select a Web framework](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Web_frameworks#How_to_select_a_web_framework)

*	Discussion [here](https://www.toptal.com/php/choosing-between-symfony-and-laravel-frameworks) about Laravel vs Symfony. 
*	[Symfony vs Laravel : Which PHP framework to choose?](https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/symfony-vs-laravel-php-framework-choose/)

If you were going to use one, I’d suggest getting started with Laravel. 

### Django (Python)
*	Written in Python, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) is a very powerful framework that works particularly well with large datasets.
*	Uses the Model-View-Template pattern rather than MVC. Read more [here](https://djangobook.com/mdj2-django-structure/)

## Express (built upon Node.js)
*	[Express](https://expressjs.com)
*   "Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications."
*	Very flexible but can be steep learning curve for beginners

## Rails (Ruby)
*	Another programming language - Ruby
*	[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org)
*	MVC

## Dangers of using frameworks
To reiterate what Zeldman described earlier, a good Web developer will understand that there are many tools available in the toolbox, however that doesn’t mean you should use them all.

It is very common to stick to what you know, instead of thinking about whether or not it is the best framework to use. I’d encourage you to think carefully about using a framework before getting attached to it. 

## Benefits of using frameworks
*   Speed! 
*   Better code
*   Security
