## Module 3: Content Management Systems

_Workshops are not recorded_

Rather than breaking down by week, I'll just group all the content here so you can follow along as needed. 

### Content
*   [CMS introduction](9.1.md)
*   [Wordpress intro](9.2.md)
*   [Wordpress themes](9.3.md)

### Groupwork process
You will form the groups yourselves. 

This is a reasonably standardised workflow that you might follow:
*   Create live version on remote server, add some base pages/ test content
*   Create local version on each team members computer
*   Sync the databases between the 2. You could do so using [WP-Sync](https://github.com/wp-sync-db/wp-sync-db)
*   Define the exact tasks that each team member will complete.
*   Start work on the theme, push changes to GitHub and ensure your team member pulls the most recent changes before they do anything.
*   Don’t work on the same file at the same time - or you will get conflicts. You can manage these through GitHub, but if you just avoid them altogether it will make your life easier!
*   While one person works on the theme, another might start uploading the content to the remote site, this will mean than once the theme development is over you can just upload it to Wordpress and the content will be there straigth away. 

You can definitely both work on the remote version at the same time (often known as cowboy coding), but don’t change the same file at the same time. If you get it working locally it will be much faster to develop. 

Ultimately, you'll need your theme files (and commit history) in GitHub, so do keep that in mind.

### Creating a workflow
Everyone has a different workflow, you mgiht find it interesting to read a few and then think about how you'll do it:

*   [No more Cowboy coding: Improving your Wordpress workflow](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/improve-wordpress-development-workflow-local-server/)
*   [A workflow for wordpress development](http://www.developersworkflow.com)
*   [My WordPress Development Workflow 2018](https://digisavvy.com/2018/05/wordpress-development-workflow-2018/)
*   
If you create your own great workflow then let us all know in the discussion forum!

### Better hosting
SiteGround has come through with the goods, if you sign up using your UC student email address, you can get proper free hosting (with less weird-ness): [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com/students/). Highly recommend. 

### Assessment information 

Got to the [Project 2](../assessment/index.md) page to see the project briefs and access the source content. 

Visit the [Scrum information](https://uc-design.github.io/scrum/) page for more information about Scrum, and how we'll use it to manage the group work process.
