# Wordpress themes

## What is a theme?
A theme is a group of files that alter the appearance of your wordpress site. There are a few types of themes:
- free
- paid 
- custom

People use different themes for different purposes. If you were just running a blog, then you'd probably find a great free theme and go with it. If you wanted a few more fancy features then you might find a paid theme on a site like [Theme Forest](https://themeforest.net). If you wanted to really stand out from the crows with your own unique style then you would use a custom theme. 

## How to make a theme
There are a few options here and I won't go into too much detail as there are a heap of resources available online. Generally, you would find a base theme (or starter theme) and then use it as a starting platform for your own work. In some instances people will code the HTML and CSS needed for the site - and then drop the Wordpress php in as required - both models work and you should do whatever you think is most appropriate. 

Personally, in my own work, I always find a simple base theme and build upon it. Some of the more popular ones include:
- [Roots: Sage](https://roots.io/sage/) HTML5 using boilerplate and bootstrap
- [Joints WP](http://jointswp.com) HTML5 using Zurb's foundation framework
- [Underscores](http://underscores.me) Designed to be hacked - lightweight
- [WP Skeleton](https://github.com/wycks/WP-Skeleton-Theme) - uses Skeleton theme 
- [WP Bootstrap](https://github.com/arnabwahid/wordpress-bootstrap) - uses Bootstrap as a base

> A note about relying on paid themes - many people will take a paid theme, change the colours and go with it. But be careful using this approach as it can devalue the site as they often look very generic. 

## Theme types
There are two ways to do this:
1. Make a 'parent' theme
2. Make a 'child' theme

### A parent theme 
A good way to think of this is as the uppermost theme - this is the theme that is controlling the appearance of your site.
You can extend a parent theme by creating a child theme (see below). 

Or, importantly, if you are creating a highly customised theme then you would make all changes to the parent theme files. This is what the Underscores starter theme is designed for.

### A child theme
A child theme inherits functionality of a parent theme, and allows you to build upon it. If you were just focusing on styling the site, with a few changes to the HTML output then you should create, and edit, a child theme. [Read WP docs](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)

On the other hand, if you were making  more substantial site that involved a lot of custom functionality then you should make your own 'parent' theme.

## Developing the theme
A few steps to get into the development (assuming you've already installed wordpress locally or on a server).

### Child theme process
1. Upload both the parent and child theme files - (Appearance > Themes)
2. Activate the child theme
3. Ensure all the settings are right - some themes will include some customisation options
4. Open the main site in your browser window
5. Open the CSS in another window
6. Start implementing your design 

> Remember, Wordpress will output simple HTML and CSS, so you just need to edit it accordingly. As you start moving through the process you might need to edit the HTML - refer to the [wordpress docs](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/) to see what pages to edit.

### Parent theme process
1. If you are editing a parent theme, you will probably want to change the name of the theme so you can actually find it. Go into the 'style.css' file and update the text accordingly.
2. Zip the whole folder and install the theme via the Wordpress interface (Appearance > Themes)
3. Activate your new theme
4. Open the main site in your browser window
5. Open the CSS in another window
6. Start implementing your design 

## Then what?
It's really a process of jumping in and seeing what you can do. What can you change? What does what? Play around and you will get the hang of it quickly. 

Wordpress has a huge development community and as a result there is a lot of information freely available online. If you need help, or want to read more about themes, start with the [Wordpress Theme Docs](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/).

## Wordpress templates
Templates are the important files that make up the theme for your site.

You should head straight to the Wordpress Template Reference which has a wealth of detailed information.
