# CMS Introduction 

**What even is a Content Management System (CMS)?**

An application that allows a user to create and manage digital content. 

They separate content and presentation and allow users to add, edit, maintain and delete content that is displayed as (or on) a web page. 

## Pros
* 	Allows the user (customer) to be able to update the data themselves
*	Often collaborative environment - multiple users, different roles etc.  
*	The use of themes allows the visual appearance to be quickly and easily updated. 

## Cons
*	Speed. Speed. Speed.
*	Security
* 	Conflation

### Common features
*	Easy installation and upgrade functionality
*	Templates for theming
*	Built-in user management
*	Modular and easily extendable (through plugins)
*	Web-based publishing
*	Compliance with accessibility standards
*	Fast development process (no need to write large amount of code to get started)


## How does it work?

Unlike a static website, a CMS needs to be run on a server as the pages are generated automatically according to database requests - this is all hidden by the CMS. 

The content is stored in a database (often MySQL)

Templates written in PHP are stored on the server

When you request a page, the CMS application retrieves the content from the database, inserts it into the php templates, which are then rendered as HTML pages and returned to the browser... all in under a few seconds.

> Picture this: you've got an image gallery with 20 photos, you need to get them online quickly and show both the thumbnail and a larger image within a modal style box when it is clicked on. You could manually resize each image in photoshop, before hard coding the HTML required to show each individual image - or you could just upload them to to your CMS and allow it to resize and generate the code to show them. 





## Key types of CMS’

### Coupled 

Means that both the content component (back-end) and presentation component (front-end) run in a single unified application. This is the most common kind of CMS, sometimes referred to as a legacy or traditional CMS.

*	[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org)
*	[Joomla](https://www.joomla.org) 

### Headless

Utilises the back-end component of the CMS (for ease of editing/adding/removing content) but makes content accessible via an API for a developer to then easily build their own interface for different devices. 

Good for multiple channels - i.e. the web browser is no longer the primary point of access

*	[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) - a React-based framework, often used with WP

### Decoupled / Hybrid

A decoupled CMS contains both front and back-end components, but they aren’t connected through a database like a traditional coupled CMS. Instead the front-end and back-end communicate to each other through API (Application Programming Interface) calls.

### Static

A static site is a pure html, css and js based website. Rather than writing all the files by hand, you use a static site generator to build the website.

The process of building a static website is much the same as with a CMS. You need to create your template files, and the content, and then run the script which pulls all the files together to generate the final site. As there are no requests to databases or any PHP so the site is considerably faster.

## Most popular

Wordpress is by far the [most popular CMS](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all/), used by more than 33.5% of all websites worldwide, followed by Joomla, Drupal, Shopify, Squarespace and Wix. 

We’ll focus on Wordpress for the rest of the unit. Although, for the final project, you can use whatever CMS you like.
