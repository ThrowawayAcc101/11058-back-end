        <p>We will work though these in the workshop</p>


        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <h3>What is server-side vs client side</h3>
        <p>Server-side means that it is executed on the server before being served to the client (the user), client-side means that it runs in browser. So, a wordpress site consists of code which doesn’t function locally - you need to run it from a server so that it works. A site with JS in it, is client-side and will run locally.</p>

        <h3>Server-side languages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There are many! Two of the most common are php and Node.js. Others include: C# and VB.Net (Microsoft); Java (different to javascript), Python, Ruby.
            </li>
            <li>Which one you use depends on what you are building. Instagram was built in Python, many search systems are built with Java. Wordpress and Facebook built with php. Most common ‘progressive’ languages are PHP and Node.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>PHP</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hypertext preprocessor</li>
            <li>Originally stood for Personal Home Page</li>
            <li>Created in 1993. Open source (free).</li>
            <li>Popular, good for many different purposes. Relatively easy to learn/get started with. </li>
            <li>Code is executed on the server and results are returned to browser as plain html (and css). </li>

        </ul>


        <h3>Node.js</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>(JS! what?!) </li>
            <li>Created in 2009. Open source (free).</li>
            <li>Allows developers to write JS which is executed outside the browser. </li>
            <li>JS is nice - Node unifies the development/design around a single language </li>
            <li>JS files can be run through a CLI</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>CLI</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Command Line Interface</li>
            <li>Anyone remember the old DOS/terminal style interaction? This is that</li>
            <li>Everyone can run a CLI from their computer</li>
            <li>You can connect to server through a CLI and run tasks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Workspace implications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Local or remote development?</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Easier to develop locally as you can test everything quickly and easily</li>
        <li>Ultimately will need to transfer content to server - lots of ways of doing that:
            <ul>
                <li>Main files with File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</li>
                <li>Any databases will need to be recreated online</li>
                <li>Pull from GitHub</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>We won’t cover all of this just yet, but good to be aware of for later</li>


        <h3>Local development</h3>

        <p>In order to develop your server-side code locally you need to create a server on your own computer. </p>
        <p>Luckily this is easy to do!</p>

        <p>Download and install <a hef="https://www.mamp.info/en/">MAMP</a> (free version for mac and pc) <br> (We don’t need MAMP Pro)</p>

        <p>When you install MAMP make sure you make note of the document root</p>

        <p>As an aside, OSX already has the Apache server software installed, but not MySQL (which we’ll need later). So using MAMP can be easier. If you did want to just use the default OSX version, follow the steps on <a href="https://mallinson.ca/posts/5/the-perfect-web-development-environment-for-your-new-mac">this page</a> (scroll down to Apache header) - note that you will need to change a few configuration files - I won’t provide technical support for this!</p>


        <h3>Intro to PHP</h3>

        <h4>Open MAMP </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Click start server button</li>
            <li>Then go to ‘Open WebStart Page’ </li>
            <li>Or, if that won’t open, try going to http://localhost:8888</li>
            <li>You might not see anything… yet. But hopefully you won’t get a 404 error. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Once we know MAMP is running, let’s set up the repository (our project)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to GitHub online and create a new repo</li>
            <li>Give it a meaningful name, e.g. ‘wk2-intro’</li>
            <li>Then clone it to you computer </li>
            <li>Save the repo in your root MAMP folder</li>
            <li>We’ll use a standard folder structure</li>
            <li>Refresh the localhost page, you should see your new folder come up</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Open Brackets</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Change the site folder to your new repo (in the MAMP folder)</li>
            <li>Create a new file, save it as ‘index.php’</li>
            <li>Add the default html5 page structure</li>
            <li>Between the <pre>&lt; body&gt;</pre>tags, add the following:</li>
            <li>
                <?php echo “hello world” ; ?>
            </li>
            <li>Go back to the browser and click the folder name, it will load the index.php page and you should see the </li>text
            <li>‘hello world’ displayed in the browser. </li>
            <li>The syntax is fairly straight forward:</li>
            <li>you start with a <br> &lt;?php </li>
            <li>Then a function or some code which will execute</li>
            <li>Close it with a ?&gt;</li>
            <li>‘Echo’ or ‘print’ will display the output on the page</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>PHP 101</h3>

        <h4>Comments</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a # for multiple lines </li>
            <li>Or a // </li>
        </ul>

        <p>There's a great little starter tutorial <a href="https://www.learn-php.org">here</a>. We won’t need everything, but good to be aware of how it works so that you can understand what is occurring.</p>


        <h3>Node.js</h3> Ok, so let’s move onto Node.js and the CLI (command line interface)

        <h4>Installation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ </li>
            <li>Download the zip or dmg for your computer</li>
            <li>Run the installer and do as it says</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Test</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Now let’s make sure it is working properly. </li>
            <li>Mac:<br> Open terminal. The easiest way is to press CMD + space and start writing ‘terminal;’ hit enter to open it</li>
            <li>Windows: <br> Open the command prompt. Click the windows menu, type ‘cmd’ and it should come up. </li>
            <li>At the command prompt type: node --version</li>
            <li>You should see the version number appear</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Create a file</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Now that we know that node is working properly, let’s create a file </li>
            <li>From Brackets, create a new file, call it ‘node-test.js’ </li>
            <li>save it into the wk2-intro folder from before</li>
            <li>In the new file, add the following: `console.log(“hello node world”);` </li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Execute the file </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>To get this to work, you need to navigate to the folder location using text commands </li>

            <li>First we need to find where we are...
                <ul>
                    <li>Type `ls` and hit enter</li>
                    <li>You’ll see a list of the current directory</li>
                    <li>Navigate to the correct directory by typing `cd foldername` e.g. `cd dropbox` then hit enter</li>
                    <li>Use `ls` again to see the structure and repeat as needed</li>
                    <li>Finally you should end up in the ‘wk2-intro’ folder </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Now, to execute the file, we write `node node-test.js`</li>
            <li>*Hopefully* we see the line ‘hello node world’ appear in the CLI</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Brilliant, we can now get both PHP and Node to work.</p>

        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/development_environment">Create server with Node.js </a></p>

        <h4>Now, while we’re here, let’s push our repo back to github. </h4>

        <p>See if github is installed by typing `git --version`</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If yes, it will show version number</li>
            <li>If not, it should prompt you to install</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Assuming we are still in the site folder </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Check that all is ok by typing ‘git init’</li>
            <li>Should get a ‘initialised or initialised’ message</li>
            <li>Run git add . (just to be sure)</li>
            <li>Run git commit -m “commit message e.g. new code from workshop”</li>
            <li>This commits the changes, but they won’t be on GitHub yet, to do that we need to then actually push them to the remote repository</li>
            <li>git push -u origin master<br> Enter username and password </li>
            <li>Success! (hopefully)
                <ul>
                    <li>If authentication fails it might be caused from having two-factor authentication enabled. To get around that, you need to create a personal access token, see <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/">this guide</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Try again…</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you have a merge conflict (hopefully not!) you may end up in the vim editor. To get out of that type `:wq`</p>

        <h4>That's it for today</h4>
