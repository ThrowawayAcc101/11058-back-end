### Notes



## What is...?

### Quick quiz! (answers later)

Talk to the person next to you and see what you know! 

1. A server     
2. Client side vs server side     
3. back-end vs front-end     
4. unix vs windows     
5. Apache vs IIS     
6. The stack    
7. Full-stack developer    


## What is... ?

### A server

A computer designed specifically to process requests and return data to a user over the internet (or network)

### Client side vs server side

- Client side means that the script is executed in the browser
- Server side means that the script is executed on the server

### Back-end vs front-end
- Back-end is essentially the server-side
- Front-end is the client-side (the interface for the user)

### Unix vs Windows
- Different operating systems
- Windows needs a license ($$$) 

- Unix is open source
- Different systems have different OS requirements

### Apache vs IIS

- Different server software
- Apache (Unix); Internet Information Services (IIS)  (Windows)
- As before, depends on the client/product being developed
- Apache most common

### The technology stack (aka the stack)

A traditional one was LAMP:
- Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP

MEAN:
- MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS

JAM:
- Javascript API Markup


### Full-stack developer
- Someone who is capable (and confident) in writing code for both the back-end and front-end 

You!


## Let's have a look
- A traditional static site (just html, css, js)
- CMS - Wordpress (e.g. [Ben demo](http://dev.beneb.com/testwp/)) (LAMP)
- Web application (e.g. [Shopify](http://shopify.com), [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com)) (LAMP)
- Progressive Web App (Google docs)
- Data driven (e.g. [Printsandprintmaking](http://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/explore) ) (JAM)



## Creating an online space
- GitHub
- Domains
- Web Hosting


## Creating an online space
### GitHub

- Sign up to [GitHub](http://github.com)
- Download [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (mac and PC):  
- If it asks you to install command line tools too, say yes!
- Make sure you can create a repo, 
- Make/edit readme

## Creating an online space
### Domains

- To make a website accessible online you need to do two things: get hosting + get a domain name.
- These are normally linked together (i.e. same host / same domain registrar) not always
- If not, you need to know the nameservers for your web host

### Web hosting

Website hosting can be a murky world, there are lots of promises and deals that sound too good to be true - they often are. A few things to remember:

- Don't be swayed by massive size quotas. Most websites would be much less than 15mb in size. 
- Watch out for the lowest price - many companies say things like 'Only 3.75 a month!' But that price is only valid if you buy 3 years up front!

- Decide if you want to pay month to month or yearly. Often a discount is available if you buy a year upfront.
- Example: [Crazy Domains](https://www.crazydomains.com.au/web-hosting/)


### Web hosting (traditional approach)

- Register a domain name and sign up for web hosting:
- A quick google:
- [Lithium Hosting](https://lithiumhosting.com) $3 p/m. .com $12.76 p/a
- [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com.au) $1.49 p/m inc domain 

- Can take 24-48 hours for DNS settings to propagate

### Web hosting (other techniques)

You can also try using cloud hosting platforms:
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/) - they have a free student account, which will allow you to run a Wordpress instance
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) (good for static sites)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)

### Web hosting 


You need to submit your sites online in this unit, so you will need to either get your own hosting or find a shared solution somehow.
